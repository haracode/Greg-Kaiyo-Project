Greg’s submission for Kaiyo’s coding exercise.

A simple Python Flask web application that keeps track of furniture brands that are purchased as a group.

Requirements:
- There should be one page and on that page there should be a list of brands 
- A user is able to select (and unselect) one or more brands and then press a button to record a purchased together. 
- You cannot purchase if no brands are selected.
- Brands should be able to be purchased multiple times
- A running list of orders is displayed at the bottom of the web page


How to use the program:
1) Mark 1 or more checkboxes to select brand(s) to be added to your order
2) Hit the purchase button to create an order
3) Continue creating orders, as many as you desire
